# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Catalog Analysis

ðŸ“Œ *Note: This report is written entirely in Spanish.*

This project was developed as the final assignment for the **Descriptive Analytics** course at ITBA. It presents an in-depth analysis of Netflix's movie and series catalog based on a public dataset with over 8,000 titles.

We aimed to explore how Netflix's content offering has changed over time and what patterns can be uncovered through descriptive statistics, data cleaning, and visual exploration.

## ðŸ“Š Project Summary

Some of the key questions we answered in this project:

- **Which countries are most represented on Netflix?**  
  â†’ The U.S. dominates in volume, but its share has declined over time as Netflix expanded globally.

- **When were most movies and series added to the platform?**  
  â†’ A major spike in content additions happened between 2015 and 2019.

- **What types of content grew the most?**  
  â†’ International movies, dramas, and comedies had the strongest growth. Documentaries peaked in specific years.

- **How did the balance between movies and series evolve?**  
  â†’ Initially, Netflix offered mostly movies, but starting around 2016, the number of series added grew significantly.

We used techniques such as outlier detection, missing value analysis, chi-square and T-tests, correlation analysis, and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to support our conclusions.
